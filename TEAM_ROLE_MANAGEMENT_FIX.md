# Team Role Management Fix

## Issue
The admin page team management was not allowing role changes due to several issues:

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The `team_members` table was missing `email` and `member_id` columns that the TypeScript interface expected
2. **Poor UI/UX**: Role selection was using a text input with datalist instead of a proper dropdown
3. **Code Bugs**: There were bugs in the `deleteMemberByName` method in TeamService
4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Limited debugging information for role update failures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/006_add_team_members_columns.sql`
- **File**: `scripts/fix-team-roles.sql`
- Added missing `email` and `member_id` columns to `team_members` table
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Fixed RLS policies

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/AdminTeam.tsx`
- Changed role input from text field with datalist to proper dropdown select
- Improved role badge styling (better contrast with dark theme)
- Added better error handling and debugging information

### 3. Code Bug Fixes
- **File**: `src/services/teamService.ts`
- Fixed `deleteMemberByName` method that had undefined variables
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Debug Tools
- **File**: `src/components/admin/TeamRoleDebugger.tsx`
- Added a debug component that appears in development mode
- Allows testing role updates with detailed feedback
- Shows current vs new role comparison

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor or via CLI
-- File: scripts/fix-team-roles.sql
```

### Step 2: Test Role Updates
1. Go to Admin â†’ Team Management
2. Click "Edit" on any team member
3. Change the role using the dropdown (now a proper select field)
4. Save changes
5. If in development mode, use the "Role Debugger" component for detailed testing

### Step 3: Verify Changes
- Check that roles update properly in the UI
- Verify that changes sync to Member Management (if applicable)
- Check browser console for any errors

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Role Selection**: Dropdown instead of text input
2. **Database Consistency**: Schema now matches TypeScript interfaces
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Console logs and debug component
4. **Improved Error Messages**: More descriptive error feedback
5. **Visual Improvements**: Better role badge styling

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can edit existing team member roles
- [ ] Role dropdown shows all available options
- [ ] Changes save successfully
- [ ] UI updates immediately after save
- [ ] No console errors during role updates
- [ ] Role changes sync to Member Management (if configured)

## Notes

- The debug component (`TeamRoleDebugger`) only appears in development mode
- The migration is safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- All changes are backward compatible
- RLS policies ensure proper security

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can:
1. Remove the debug component import from AdminTeam.tsx
2. Revert the dropdown back to text input if needed
3. The database columns are safe to keep (they're optional)
